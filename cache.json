"{\"cover_letter\":\"Dear Hiring Manager,\\n\\nI’m writing to express my interest in backend/Python engineering opportunities at Google in Australia. I’m an onshore Melbourne-based Python Backend Engineer with 7+ years’ experience building and operating microservices and data-intensive systems across FastAPI/Django, event-driven architectures (Kafka/RabbitMQ), and PostgreSQL/ClickHouse/Redis. I currently work remotely as a Senior Python Engineer and I’m completing a Master of Information Technology at Torrens University Australia (expected December 2027).\\n\\nAcross my recent roles, I’ve focused on delivering reliable, observable services and improving platform efficiency through simplification, automation and strong engineering practices.\\n\\nRelevant experience aligned to large-scale product engineering includes:\\n\\n- Building and operating high-load microservices with a strong focus on low latency, reliability and observability (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Tarantool), including structured logging, tracing and metrics with tools such as OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana and Sentry.\\n- Designing security-focused audit/event logging capabilities and exporting events to external security tools (SIEM/CEF), collaborating with cross-functional teams to define requirements and enable enterprise onboarding.\\n- Improving architecture and operational efficiency by consolidating multiple synchronous services into a single asynchronous multi-cloud service, reducing Kubernetes footprint and improving throughput and p95 latency.\\n- Developing internal platform libraries to standardise secure service-to-service communication (authentication, proxy/cert handling) and add observability hooks (trace propagation, structured logging) to improve consistency across teams.\\n- Delivering data engineering outcomes by establishing batch ETL using dbt + Apache Spark to consolidate and model data from PostgreSQL into ClickHouse, enabling a dedicated analytics layer.\\n- Strengthening delivery practices through GitLab CI/CD pipelines to build and publish internal Python libraries to a private package repository (Nexus), improving release consistency and dependency management.\\n\\nI’m comfortable working in Docker/Kubernetes environments and contributing to teams that value code review, automated testing (pytest), performance/SQL optimisation, and robust incident response practices.\\n\\nWork rights: I am currently onshore in Melbourne and available for full-time work; however, I will require employer sponsorship under the TSS 482 visa. I’m also open to relocating within Australia for the right role.\\n\\nThank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my backend engineering experience in scalable services, observability and data platforms could contribute to Google’s engineering teams.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\nIvan Bazhenov\"}"
